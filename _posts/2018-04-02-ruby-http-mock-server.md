Good News, Everyone!

Some days ago I needed to use a mock server to test a feature I was working on. There are a lot of similar projects online but none of them allowed me to inspect the request easily. So I decided to create mine, a tool where it's also possible to use `pry` and check parameters and headers.

Here is the result:
<https://github.com/blocknotes/http-mock-server>

Configuration via YAML file, an example is shown on the project page.

I hope you find it useful.
