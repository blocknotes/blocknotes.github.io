excerpt: A Material theme for Administrate based on Materialize framework
---

In the last days I prepared a theme for [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate)
(a tool to create admin dashboards) using [Materialize framework](https://materializecss.com/).

The main features of my component are:
- uses only CSS (and very few JS), no structural changes are required;
- it's responsive and tested on mobile browsers;
- allows to use *Materialize* styles/grid/widgets in the admin.

Colors, fonts and the other Materialize options can be customized as expected by
the framework via SCSS variables.

Please take a look at the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/blocknotes/administrate-materialize-theme) and feel free to leave comments about it.
